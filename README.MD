## 🤓 Background

GitHub allows you to [co-author commits](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors/) by appending `Co-authored-by: name <name@example.com>` to a commit message.

## 🧠 Advanced (optional)

To speed up your workflow you can preinstall co-commit using `npm i -g co-commit`.

You can also utilize git flags with co-commit: eg `git commit --force` becomes `npx commit --force`. Additionally, you can skip prompts using flags: eg: `-m "your commit message"` or `-c "mariiapunda, juliettepretot"`.
